// add solution here
function theBeatlesPlay(musicians, instruments){
  for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++){
    array.push(`${musicians[0]} plays ${instruments[0]}`)
  }
return array

// needs to take each element from both arrays
// loop with a counter, i= 0, some condition, i ++1
// `${musicians[0]} plays ${instruments[0]}`
// need to add to array, I think .push is okay because we only need one array
// return
